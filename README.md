## Planning Story

For this project I decieded to build a personal library that a user can use to keep track of the books that they have read.  I used jQuery and javascript for most of the front end calculations and DOM manipulation.  The back end of this project can be found at the link above.


### Users stories
- As a User I would like to be able to add a book that I have read to my Read library
- As a User I would like to be able to add a book that I want to read to my Still waiting to Read library
- As a User I would like to be able to add a comment to a book that I have read so I can look back at it if I want a refresher on the book or author
- As a User I would like to be able to Update or delete my books or comments
- As a User I would like to be able to view either all of my books or just a specific one.

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS/SASS
- Javascript

### Unsolved Problems

- Would like to eventually enable comments on books so that a User can see what they thought of the book.
- I would like to make the background more appealing to the user
- I would like to incorperate bootstraps modals to give the site better UI
